# What's new

# Changes from 0.5 to 0.6

 * [NEW] Parameter Transformers: It is now possible to add transformation functions to experiment's parameters. This can be handy to iterate experiments on complex parameters (Objects, complex generators) but exporting simpler string in the output files.
 * [NEW] Private Generators are generators that will be used in the iterations but they will not be output in the result egg.
 * [FIX] Some bugs in the command line interface.
